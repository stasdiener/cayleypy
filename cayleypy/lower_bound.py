    BFS from the central state gives exact distances for all states within some radius ``d`` of it. For a state inside
    that ball, the exact distance is returned, which is the strongest possible bound. Every other state is at distance
    at least ``d+1``, and that is what is returned for it. The larger the ball, the stronger the bound - and the more
    memory it takes (one hash per state in the ball).

    Generators must be inverse-closed, so that distance from the central state to a state is equal to distance from
    that state back to the central state.
