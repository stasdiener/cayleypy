class ModelConfig:
    """Configuration used to describe ML model.

    Fields `n_outputs`, `tokenizer_groups` and `graph_hash` describe capabilities added after the first version of this
    class. Their defaults describe a single-output model without tokenization, which is not tied to a particular graph,
    so configs written before these fields existed keep working.

    :param model_type: Type of the model, e.g. "MLP".
    :param input_size: Number of elements in one state.
    :param num_classes_for_one_hot: Number of distinct values one element of a state can take.
    :param layers_sizes: Sizes of hidden layers.
    :param weights_kaggle_id: Id of the Kaggle model with weights (optional).
    :param weights_path: Path to the file with weights (optional).
    :param n_outputs: Number of outputs of the model. 1 means the model predicts distance for the state it is applied
        to. `n_generators` means the model predicts distance for every child of that state (Q-model).
    :param tokenizer_groups: Specification of how elements of a state are grouped into tokens, as a list of
        ``[group_size, num_groups]`` pairs. For example, ``[[3, 20], [2, 30]]`` means 20 tokens of 3 elements followed
        by 30 tokens of 2 elements. None means the state is not tokenized.
    :param graph_hash: Hash of the graph this model was trained for, see :func:`cayleypy.models.graph_hash`.
